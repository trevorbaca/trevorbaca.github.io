          <p>Artist's statement:</p>
          <p>
            <em>I understand my music as emotive encoding. I write because I
            feel an emotional compulsion to write — to give form to fantastic
            or impossible colors and shapes as sound and as pleasure — and,
            yet, when I write, I am intensely aware of the fact that I am
            setting up and taking apart a code. I write for different
            combinations of instruments in chamber and orchestral settings
            and the written score is an important part of how I work. The act
            of score preparation is, for me, an emotional effort deeply
            concerned with the weight and energy and physical charge of raw
            and vibrant sounds, and, in equal measure, a type of work that is
            surpassingly symbolic, intimately bound up with the networks of
            potential meaning set up by marks on the page. I reject any
            dichotomy that pits the analytic against the emotional. Symbols
            can, and do, cut like knives. And I work for a music that is
            everywhere an emotional play of symbols, complete with all the
            almost unworkable contradictions such a play of symbols
            carries.</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>I don't understand either the societal or psychological parts
            of the composer role. And I would just as soon replace it with
            some other type of work carrying some other type of baggage.
            Sorcery, perhaps. A special appeal to concentration, with concern
            for a secret language of symbols, a secret way of reading the
            events and details of the natural world. I want music to be an
            intensely shared and public experience. And I want the intensity
            of that experience to result, at least in part, from an effort of
            decipherment, and translation, on all our parts.</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>My music comes back again and again to a constellation of
            images, and desire. The beauty of reflected and refracted light.
            The relationships between code and power and time. The assertion
            of power and importance in an everyday type of living. The
            delicacy of flowers and their parts. And networks of people and
            our relationships. I believe that there is something utterly
            human in rendering flashes of these ideas as symbols on the page,
            designed specifically for experience in some other, potentially
            unknown, place.</em>

            Bača is the inventor of <a
            href="https://abjad.github.io/">Abjad</a>, a Python-based
            open-source software system for music composition. Since 2016
            Bača has led weeklong intensive summer courses about Abjad at
            Stanford University's CCRMA; Bača is proud to participate in
            Stanford's Women in Computer Music Scholarship. In August 2009
            Bača completed a two-week residency at Schloss Solitude in
            Stuttgart with performances by Ensemble SurPlus. Bača's music has
            been anthologized as part of <em>Notations 21</em> (edited by
            Theresa Sauer) and Bača's scores have been exhibited as art at
            the Chelsea Gallery in New York City and at the Hutchins Gallery

            Bača holds a PhD in music composition from Harvard University. In
            2019 Bača joined the faculty of the Department of Music of Yale
            University, where he lectures on 20th- and 21st-century music.
