          <h2>Program note</h2>
          <p>
            The following inscription, written by the composer, appears at
            the head of the score:
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>At the interface of the world and the tangled skein of light,
            color and heat in which it writes its name we find the body and the
            flickering collection of sensations that draws around it. Nerves
            mediate the world in their silent administration of the body’s
            signals and responses; but, myelinated and cold, the nerves’
            channels’ coating now resists the touch of forefinger and thumb and
            resists, too, the thin translucence of the gloves that endure the
            hours of our investigation. Hands travel the body’s insides; hands
            trace the contours of the spine. The colored islands of our
            experience align to the body and the collection of its parts.</em>
          </p>
          <hr>
          <h2>Further notes</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Flute.</strong> Three flutes are required. These are the
            piccolo, alto flute and contrabass flute. Notes marked as pizzicati
            in the flute may be performed as tongue pizzicati or as lip
            pizzicati or as a mixture of the two. Short angled lines drawn
            through note stems indicate flutter tongue. Square note heads on
            the usual five-line staff indicate notes that are to be played with
            the lips completely covering the mouth plate of the flute. When
            square note heads are accompanied by a wavy trill spanner headed
            with a capital R then an unvoiced trill of the tongue should be
            played into the body of the flute with the mouth plate covered by
            the lips.
          </p>

          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Guitar.</strong> The pitches marked <em>jeux des
            harmoniques</em> indicate only where the lowest string on the
            guitar is to be fingered; these harmonics are to be played with the
            side of a hard pic and will sound a different partial of the
            stopped string at each attack. Square note heads written on the
            usual five-line staff and marked RH hiss glissandi are to be played
            with the thumb and forefinger of the right hand pinching one of
            smoother upper nylon strings of the guitar and then running quickly
            up or down the stopped string to produce a characteristic hissing
            sound. Scraped guitar cadenza. The notes written as crosses towards
            the end of the piece comprise a type of cadenza. These cross-shaped
            notes are marked with up-bow and down-bow indicators and are all to
            be played on the lowest string of the instrument in a special way.
            The left hand is to execute these cross-shaped notes by grasping
            the string firmly between the thumb and forefinger to lift the
            string up some distance away from the fingerboard and its frets and
            stop the string at the pitches indicated. The right hand is to
            execute these cross-shaped notes by drawing the serrated edge of a
            metal bolt or metal screw against the string at a distance of only
            one or two centimeters directly in front of the thumb and
            forefinger of the left hand; the bristles of a plastic comb or
            other serrated object may be used in place of the metal bolt or
            screw at the discretion of the performer; the up-bow and down-bow
            indications give the direction in which each stroke of the bolt is
            to be drawn against the string. The overall effect of the passage
            is to be the sinking sensation that accompanies the experience of
            something alien or unexpected.

          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Accordion.</strong> Cross-shaped note heads appearing on
            the one-line percussion staff and marked bellows pizz. indicate a
            type of pizzicato to executed by plucking the forefinger forcefully
            against the bellows of the instrument to cause as loud and
            well-articulated a plucking sound as possible; the technique may be
            executed with either hand and may optionally be done with the felt
            or rubber pic of a guitar instead of the fleshy part of the finger.
            Cross-shaped note heads appearing on the one-line percussion staff
            and accompanied by a wavy spanner headed with bg indicate a bellows
            guiro to be executed by drawing the backs of the fingers and the
            fingernails across the bellows. Square-shaped note heads appearing
            on the one-line percussion staff marked air tone indicate the sound
            of air forced through the bellows with the air button depressed.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Percussion.</strong> Four instruments are required.
            <strong>Marimba.</strong> The marimba must be a five-octave marimba
            extending down to C♮2. The choice of mallets is very largely left
            to the interpreter with two exceptions. The first of these are the
            cross-shaped note heads that first appear with an instruction to
            strike forcefully with a pair of paintbrushes that are held one per
            hand; the forceful dynamics that accompany the music at these
            locations are to be understood as effort dynamics that indicate the
            degree of force used to strike the keys of the instrument. The
            notes accompanied by a wavy spanner headed by either <em>br</em> or
            <em>mbr</em> are likewise to be played in a special way. Notes
            accompanied by a br spanner are a type of ‘bristle trill’ to be
            played by striking the indicated key with one of the same
            paintbrushes described above so as to encourage the production of
            some sense of pitch followed by the rapid rubbing or scrubbing of
            the bristles of the paintbrush on top of the surface of the wooden
            key; the intended effect is of a brief sense of resonant pitch
            followed by the type of white-noise sound of hair whisking rapidly
            back and forth over wood. Notes accompanied by an mbr spanner are a
            type of ‘mallet-initiated bristle trill’ to be played by striking
            the indicated key with a yarn, felt or other ‘usual’ mallet
            followed by the rapid rubbing or scrubbing of the bristles of the
            same paintbrush as described before on the surface of the wooden
            key. Note also that passages marked with angled tremolandi
            indicators are always accompanied by an indication to use bass drum
            beaters. These passages are to create a profoundly low and
            attackless sound; no other marimba tremolandi are used in the piece
            and all other struck pitches on the instrument are to be
            interpreted as tiny packets of invisible information flashing from
            moment to moment with different strengths, presence and hidden
            meaning. <strong>Bass drum, claves.</strong> Each occurs only once
            in the piece. The claves should be of a hard wood with a high
            sound. <strong>Glockenspiel.</strong> The instrument is used only
            at the end of the piece. The entrance of the instrument should be
            completely unexpected and should perhaps be placed towards the back
            of the set-up where the audience will be less likely to note the
            presence of the instrument until its entrance for that reason.
