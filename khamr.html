          <h2>Program note</h2>
          <p>
            The following inscription, written by the composer, appears at
            the head of the score:
          </p>
            <em><strong>Al-kitab al-khamr</strong> is the book of forbidden
            drink. “Khamr” is the word in the Qūr’an that prohibits the
            faithful from intoxicants: from wine and from stimulants and from
            bringers-of-visions. What things must those be that between poison
            and pleasure tack course in the body? What colors and shapes the
            forbidden inscribes as its left-behind marks on dreams and
            insoluble mind.</em>
          </p>
          <hr>
          <h2>Further notes</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Prioritization of tempo.</strong> The piece comprises two
            series of different tempi. Tempo series one sets the quarter note
            equal to 126, 63 or 31.5 (written as 32). Tempo series two sets the
            quarter note equal to 84 or 42. The tempi of the first series stand
            3:2 in relation to the tempi of the second series. Even though the
            choice of tempi are to some extent a matter of the preferences of
            the ensemble and the acoustics of the hall, the subito changes of
            tempo in the piece should be felt and conducted as exact metric
            modulations. In addition, the tempi of the very fast parts of the
            piece should be played as closely as possible to the tempi written
            in the score: it is preferable to play the dense figures in very
            fast parts of the piece as something of a blur rather than slowing
            the tempi to attack the notes carefully.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Winds.</strong> The two bass flute multiphonics in the piece
            are numbers 17 and 22 in Carin Levine’s book <em>Die Technik der
            Flötenspiel</em> and the boxed numbers in the score are reminders of
            this. Any fingerings approximating the off-octave sound of the
            multiphonics may be used. Trills without secondary noteheads are
            color trills. The saxophone multiphonic dyad in the piece is number
            77 in Marcus Weiss’s book <em>Die Technik der Saxophons</em>; the
            boxed number in the score is a reminder of this.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Guitar.</strong> The guitar is tuned as usual. The sound
            ideal for all plucked notes is as resonant as possible; interpret
            rests only as rhythmic placeholders (and not as indications to stop
            the reverberation of the notes). Cross noteheads indicate half
            harmonics; play the low E (or other open strings) marked this way
            with a type of RH plucking that best approximates the color of the
            other half harmonics. Individuated clicks indicated in the score
            should be executed by running a pick or fingernail laterally up the
            outer wire weave of the E string creating a continuous but sparse
            and irregular sound. Use a metal machinists screw of about 8 or 10
            centimeters like a type of corrugated guiro in the part of the score
            that requests screw-bowing; make up-bow and down-bow changes freely.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Piano.</strong> The piano should be prepared with a piece of
            cardboard woven between the strings of twelve notes in the octave
            from F#6 to F#7. The effect is coarsely to mute these pitches; no
            special indication is given in the score when these pitches are
            encountered. ‘Tamburo’ hits characterize the first section of the
            piece. Execute these with heel of the palm struck against the lowest
            strings inside the piano with the sustain pedal lifted; the sound
            augments the color of the tam-tam. Use a credit card run very slowly
            laterally up the weaving of the low C#1 string in the part of the
            score that requests individuated clicks.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Percussion.</strong> Six percussion instruments are
            required: (1.) one woodblock; (2.) mounted castanets; (3.) snare
            drum; (4.) bass drum; (5.) very large tam-tam (38” recommended);
            (6.) marimba. The percussion part is notated primarily on a
            single-line staff. Where cells of the five-line staff occur they
            represent a synchoronous attack on Ab5 in the marimba together with
            a single woodblock; these two instruments are always struck together
            in the piece and should be placed near each other so that each can
            be hit with a hard mallet at the same time. The tam-tam should be as
            large as possible and the tam-tam dynamics written into the score
            may be freely ignored: the goal is as resonant a sound that fills as
            much of the hall as possible without spilling over from the
            fundamental of the instrument into the less desirable upper
            frequencies. Rolls on the bass drum are all to be as close to
            attackless as possible: the rate of the roll doesn’t matter but the
            background depth provided by the instrument is important.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Strings.</strong> The violin, viola and cello are tuned as
            usual. String IV of the contrabass is tuned down to G0 (a major
            sixth lower than the usual tuning of E1) and will probably be a
            little loose as a result. (Note that that the seemingly large double
            stops in the contrabass at the interval of a minor seventh are all
            played with the fingers at the exact same position on strings III
            and IV.) The contrabass plays a special role in the piece and should
            be allowed to sound front-and-center above the other strings in many
            sections of the piece. Natural harmonic glissandi lentissimi in the
            violin, viola, cello and contrabass are designed to encourage the
            production of multiphonics and other unstable harmonics: allow the
            multiphonics and transient harmonics to sound as much as possible
            and do not adjust them back to recognizable harmonics unnecessarily.
