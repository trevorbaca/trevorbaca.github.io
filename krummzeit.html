          <h2>Program note</h2>
          <p>
            The following inscription, written by the composer, appears at
            the head of the score:
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
            <em>Trees mark time in the twists they make over the course of
            branches’ growth.<br> Arms rise sinewy in their turnings-to-sky to
            fall earthward again<br> in a tracery of parts and of the
            slow-moving shapes of time.</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            The piece is about time and about the ways the flow of time changes
            the colors and sounds and loudnesses we hear in music. Fourteen
            materials circulate through the piece. Piano chords resonate with
            the echo of other instruments; plucked strings fall from high to
            low and then rise again back up; broken bits of counterpoint pile
            up between the oboe, clarinet, harpsichord and violin; long notes
            in the viola and cello give way to the rustle of brush bristles;
            stones travel in circles across hard pieces of slate brought into
            the concert hall from outside. Running through these materials (and
            the others that stack up on and between them) is the arrow of
            musical time. The gnarled time that runs through the piece shares
            something with the time that grows the branches of trees towards
            the sky and then turns them heavy towards the ground with age: in
            the shapes of branches left over at the side of the trail we
            experience in a glance the distillate of years. So goes the analogy
            with the course of musical time in the piece: the materials and
            their colors pass us by in shapes that are the fantastic leftovers
            of something we no longer see.

          <h2>Further notes</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>The winds &amp; percussion are tranposed.</strong> The E♭
            clarinet sounds a minor third higher than written and the bass
            clarinet sounds a major ninth lower than written. The xylophone
            sounds an octave higher than written. (But note that the violin,
            viola and cello are all written at sounding pitch even for the low
            notes of their scodatura.)
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Prioritization of tempo.</strong> The proportions between
            tempi should be as exact as possible (even though the choice of
            tempi are to some extent a matter of the preferences of the
            ensemble and the acoustics of the hall). In addition, the tempi of
            the very fast parts of the piece should be played as closely as
            possible to the tempi written in the score: it is preferable to
            play the dense figures in very fast parts of the piece as something
            of a blur rather than slowing the tempi to attack each of the notes
            carefully. Speed and forcefulness of tempo must take priority
            throughout the piece.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Oboe &amp; clarinet.</strong> All trills are color trills.
            Color fingerings are given as circled Arabic numerals with greater
            numbers indicating greater deviation from normal timbre.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Piano and harpsichord.</strong> The pianist is asked to
            switch between piano and harpsichord throughout the piece. The two
            instruments should be positioned right next to each other so that
            the pianist can switch rapidly. Register settings for the
            harpsichord are encouraged even though none are given in the score.
            Piano and harpsichord clusters are all chromatic.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Percussion.</strong> Seven instruments are required: (1.) a
            single crotale (pitched in D♮); (2.) a piece of slate scraped by an
            even smaller piece of slate or another stone; (3.) a snare drum
            (played with the fingertips and never with sticks); (4.) a large
            sponge whisked across the suface of a bass drum; (5.) a single
            suspended cymbal (pitched as low as possible and played with a soft
            yarn mallet); (6.) a tam-tam (as large as possible); (7.) and a
            xylophone. A few of the switches between instrument are extremely
            fast. In cases where it is not possible to effect the switch as
            quickly as written, the last few notes of the previous material
            should be sacrificed so that the first few notes of the next
            material begin on time. The five-line staff always indicates the
            xylophone.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Strings.</strong> The the lowest strings of violin, viola
            and cello are all detuned: the lowest string of the violin should
            be taken down one semitone to F♯4; the lowest string of the viola
            should be taken down two semitones to B♭2; and the lowest string of
            the cello should be taken down three semitones to A♮1. In addition,
            the violinist is asked to play on a large piece of slate at one
            point in the piece; the slate (and small stone used for scraping in
            a circle) are to resemble those of the percussionist as closely as
            possible. Tremolo are all fast and uncounted.
